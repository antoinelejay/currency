# currency â€” Formatting currencies


## Overview

`currency` is a LaTeX package that facilitates the formatting
of currencies (amounts and units). It is based on the `siunitx` package
for printing numbers.

For instance, this code in the preamble defines a EUR monetary unit 

``` latex
\DefineCurrency{EUR}{name={euro},plural={euros},symbol={\euro},iso={EUR},kind=iso,base=2}
```

that will be used later by 

``` latex
\dEUR{123} or \dEUR[kind=plural]{123}
```
to print `123 EUR or 123 euros`. There are many ways to change to output 
(the symbol could be put in front of the amount as required by some 
typographical conventions, ...).
